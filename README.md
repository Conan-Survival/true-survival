True Survival
=============

Turns Conan Exiles into a hardcore survival game.

Most sources of easily accessible instantanious healing are removed,
debuffs last longer and should be removed with an appropriate item.

Players have a chance of receiving a bleeding debuff upon being hit and of
getting a fracture upon taking fall damage.

Players will heal naturally over time, at the cost of depleting their hunger and thirst gauges
more quickly. This effect is greatly accellerated while sheltered.
