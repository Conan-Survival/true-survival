[h2]FAQ[/h2]

[b]I fell and got a fracture. How do I fix it?[/b]

Make an *Improvised Splint* or *Splint* (unlocked separately).

[b]If Aloe Extract and Wraps don't heal me, how do I heal?[/b]

Construct or find shelter. You slowly heal over time, and much faster while sheltered.
The healing process will use your food and drink reserves.

[b]Okay so what do Bandages and Aloe Extracts do now?[/b]

They remove (external) bleeding and reduce damage from bleeding respectively.
