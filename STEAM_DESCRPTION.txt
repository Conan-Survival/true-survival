[h2]FAQ[/h2]

[b]If Aloe Extract and Wraps don't heal me, how do I heal?[/b]
Construct or find [i]shelter[/i]. Even a tent will do.
You slowly heal over time, and much faster while sheltered.

[b]Why am I becoming hungry and thirsty so fast?[/b]
The healing process will use your food and drink reserves - [i]except[/i] if you are [i]sated[/i].
Make sure to apply the [i]sated[/i] buff to yourself if you are hurt.

[b]Okay so what do Bandages and Aloe Extracts do now?[/b]
They remove (external) bleeding and reduce damage from bleeding respectively.

[b]I fell and got a fracture. How do I fix it?[/b]
Make an [i]Improvised Splint[/i] or [i]Splint[/i] (from feat).
