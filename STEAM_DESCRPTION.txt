[h2]FAQ[/h2]

[b]I fell and got a fracture. How do I fix it?[/b]
Make an [i]Improvised Splint[/i] or [i]Splint[/i] (from feat).

[b]If Aloe Extract and Wraps don't heal me, how do I heal?[/b]
Construct or find shelter. You slowly heal over time, and much faster while sheltered.
The healing process will use your food and drink reserves.

[b]Okay so what do Bandages and Aloe Extracts do now?[/b]
They remove (external) bleeding and reduce damage from bleeding respectively.
